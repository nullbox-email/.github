## Getting support

### Support requests (bugs, account issues, anything that needs follow-up)

1. Open the **Support** repository.
2. Click the **Issues** tab.
3. Click **New issue**.
4. Include:
   - what you expected
   - what happened
   - steps to reproduce (if relevant)
   - your mailbox domain or alias (if safe to share)

Use an Issue when you want a trackable request with a clear resolution.

### Questions and discussion (how it works, feedback, general chat)

Use **Organization Discussions**.

This is a good place for:
- how things work
- feature questions
- product feedback
- architecture or privacy discussion

## Open source

We plan to open source parts of the system, but we’re not ready to do that yet.
