## Getting support

### 🐞 Support requests and issues
For bugs, account issues, or anything that needs follow-up:

- Go to the **Support** repository  
- Open a new **Issue**
- Include as much detail as you can (what you expected, what happened, and any relevant context)

This is the best option if something isn’t working as expected.

### 💬 Questions and discussion
For general questions, feedback, or informal discussion:

- Use **Organization Discussions**

This is a good place for:
- How things work
- Feature questions
- Product feedback
- Architecture or privacy discussions

## What this is (and isn’t)

- This is **not** a general-purpose open-source org
- Most of Nullbox is not open source
- This space exists to provide transparent support and communication

We aim to respond, but response times may vary.
